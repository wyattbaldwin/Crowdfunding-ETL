# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Purpose

Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform used for financing independent projects. The platform needs to move all its accessible data from one large Excel file into a SQL database, so that we can perform analysis on the data provided. We will be working with Britta, a junior SQL developer to complete the following tasks:
1.	Extracting data from one large Excel file (crowdfunding.xlsx)
2.	Transform the data into five separate Excel files (campaign.csv, categories.csv, subcategories.csv, contacts.csv, and backers.csv).
3.	Create a PostgreSQL database using an entity relationship diagram (ERD) and load the CSV files into the database.
